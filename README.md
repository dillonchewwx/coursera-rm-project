As part of Coursera - [Regression Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models).

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

1. “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
2. "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
